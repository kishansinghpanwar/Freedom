    }
}

 ```
dependencies {
      implementation 'com.github.kishansinghpanwar:Freedom:v1.0.1'
}
 ```  
  - Step 3. Add the buildConfigField in Build.gradle(app) file
 

*Freedom required this parameter for fetch the build created time.*

	defaultConfig {  
		  buildConfigField "long", "FreedomTime", System.currentTimeMillis() + "L"  
	} 
}
 ```
